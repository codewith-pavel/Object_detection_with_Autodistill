# Real-Time Fire Detection with Drones and Edge Computing

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time fire detection system integrating lightweight deep learning models, drones, and edge computing. The system leverages YOLOv8, DETR, and knowledge distillation techniques for efficient fire detection in resource-constrained environments.

## üìñ Abstract
Fire accidents pose significant threats to life, property, and the environment. This project addresses the challenge by deploying a drone-based system with edge computing for real-time fire detection. Key contributions include:
- A **comprehensive dataset** of 7,187 fire images.
- **Knowledge distillation** from YOLOv8m (teacher) to YOLOv8n (student), achieving **95.21% accuracy**.
- A **custom-built drone** with Raspberry Pi 5 and Pi Camera for live inference at **8 FPS**.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Dataset**: Combined public datasets with augmented fire/no-fire images.
- **Models**: YOLOv8, DETR, Detectron2, and Autodistill-based knowledge distillation.
- **Hardware**: DJI F450 drone, Raspberry Pi 5, Pi Camera, and Pixhawk flight controller.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Lightweight YOLOv8n model optimized for edge devices.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset comprises 7,187 images across categories like forest fires, vehicle fires, and drone-view fires.

**Preprocessing steps:**

- **Augmentation**: Horizontal/vertical flips, saturation adjustments, noise addition.
- **Splitting**: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.
